               <strong>LocalStorage:</strong>
               Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity. Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
               The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of traffic between client and server.
               The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site​
               <strong>sessionStorage:</strong>
               It is similar to localStorage.
               Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is deleted
               The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set​

               <strong> Block scope</strong>
               Block scoped variables: A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be available outside the block even if the block is inside a function. <br>
               <strong> Global scope</strong>
               The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment.

               The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
               The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an              asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the         event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.

                    In a JavaScript program, the correct way to check if an object property is undefined is to use the typeof operator. If the value is not defined, typeof returns the 'undefined' string.
                    A function returns undefined if a value was not returned . Note: While you can use undefined as an identifier (variable name) in any scope other than the global scope (because undefined is not a reserved word), doing so is a very bad idea that will make your code difficult to maintain and debug.
